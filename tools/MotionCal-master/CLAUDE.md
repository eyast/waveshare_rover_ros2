This application written in C++ performs sensor calibration
it's adapted from https://www.pjrc.com/store/prop_shield.html

I want you to re-write this application using Python.
Save your work in the directory called Python
Your application should be self contained, and installable.
You must not create new functionality, you must not delete functionality.
You must not optimize any aspects that alter the application's execution.
You must not change the expected data format.

You must use PyGame as the engine to render graphics, or PyQT if you want to build interfaces/UI, it's up to you.
You must write your plan, and tasks in a file. In case your work is interrupted for any reason, you must review this file to know where to continue. in case something is broken later, you will refer to this file to find your course of action.
You will write release notes, in which you will leave traces to help you troubleshoot the program if it doesnt work.

You have already written the library of the sensor (ESP32). Your work is in the folder "yourwork". You have written the cpp file, and an accompanying Python file that was helpful. I'm only providing these files for your reference, you dont need to modify them.
