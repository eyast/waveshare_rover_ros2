; PlatformIO Project Configuration
; =============================================================================
; WHAT: This file tells PlatformIO how to build and upload your code
; WHY: Need to specify target board, libraries, and build settings

[env:esp32dev]
; Platform: Which chip family we're targeting
; esp32 = Espressif ESP32 chips
platform = espressif32

; Board: Specific board model
; esp32dev = Generic ESP32 DevKit board (most common)
; WHY: Different boards have different pin layouts, flash sizes
board = esp32dev

; Framework: Which programming framework to use
; arduino = Arduino-style C++ (setup() and loop())
; WHY Arduino: Easiest to learn, huge community, lots of libraries
framework = arduino

; Serial monitor baud rate
; MUST match Serial.begin() in your code
monitor_speed = 115200

; Build flags
; WHY: Control compiler behavior
build_flags = 
    -D CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=0    ; 0 = no debug, 5 = verbose (helps find issues)
    
; Upload settings
; speed = baud rate for uploading code (fast = quicker uploads)
upload_speed = 921600

; Library dependencies
; WHY: List external libraries needed
; NOTE: This project uses only built-in Arduino libraries - no extras needed!
lib_deps = 
    ; Wire library (I2C) is built-in to Arduino framework
    ; No external dependencies for this minimal driver
